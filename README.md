## Real-Time Collaborative Docs App

A full-stack web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage documents with real-time collaboration.

The app supports user authentication, secure document ownership, and CRUD operations for documents.  
Built with modern web technologies and designed to demonstrate scalable architecture, secure authentication, and real-time ready foundations.

**Key features:**
- User signup and login with credentials authentication
- Secure document ownership and access control
- Create, read, update, and delete documents
- Clean Next.js App Router architecture
- MongoDB-based data persistence

This project serves as a foundation for a Google Docs / Notion-like collaborative editor, with real-time synchronization planned using CRDTs.
